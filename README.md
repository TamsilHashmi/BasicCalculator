# BasicCalculator
A program for basic arithmetic operation.
This Java program implements a simple console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It uses:

Methods for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to keep the code modular and reusable.

A Scanner object to take user input for numbers and operation choice.

A loop (while) to allow repeated calculations until the user chooses to exit by selecting option 5.

The program includes basic error handling for division by zero, displays the result of each operation, and cleanly exits when requested.
